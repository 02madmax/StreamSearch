#StreamSearch

## Description
Ever aimlessly browse Netflix after a long day at work unable to choose what to watch? We've aimed to fix that. This project showcases our collaborative efforts as a team to combine our learned knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API's to create a web application that allows the user to find a movie for them based on genre and their chosen streaming services. Clicking on the genre dropdown menu will present the user with a list of the most popular movie/TV show genres. Then, clicking on one of the streaming service checkboxes will further filter a movie/TV show from the catalog of media on IMDB to randomly select something to watch specifically tailored for your viewing purpose. Less time wasted browsing, and more time wasted watching something worthwhile.

## Visuals
The following screenshot shows a preview of the website's functionality. Clicking on one of the genres from the dropdown menu will filter the catalogue of media from the IMDB API. Clicking on one of the streaming service buttons will further filter the catalogue to media currently available on that specific streaming platform:




## Installation
Simply click on the following link to be brought to the website application and begin the search for a worthwhile media binge:

## Usage
A website application that can easily find the user something to watch that both fits their taste in media as well as making sure itâ€™s available to watch on a streaming service the user is currently subscribed to. Simply select a genre, the streaming services you have a subscription to, and our application will find you something to watch.
